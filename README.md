# firebase-chat-app

This is a basic chat app coded up using simple HTML. At present in this chat up you can add username and message and it will start syncing as soon as you hit the enter button.

The uploaded version doesn't has Firebase addedup in the backend but can be done by checking the comments to find out where it should be actually added.
